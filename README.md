# Linear Regression for price prediction
This portfolio project demonstrates my basic data sciece skills.
It follows the dataset analysis from Chapter 1 form "Hands-On Machine Learning" by A. Geron (which I'm carefully studying for the second time)

Instead of picking some dataset from Kaggle and doing some random manipulatiuons to sqeeze out some insight from it, I decided to solidify my skills by following the the basic instructions from a professional.
